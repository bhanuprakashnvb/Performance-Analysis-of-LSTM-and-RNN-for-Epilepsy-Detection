# Performance-Analysis-of-LSTM-and-RNN-for-Epilepsy-Detection
Epilepsy is the one of the most common neurological disorder in the world. Automatic detection of these Epileptic seizures can considerably improve the patient's quality of life. We propose a new framework that learns directly from the data, without extracting a feature set which automatically learns the discriminative EEG features of epileptic seizures. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are developed as independent models to learn the high-level representations of the normal and the seizure EEG pattern, these two Deep learning models are trained and tested respectively and contrasted on various metrics for their performance analysis and coming out with Best Model to Classify Epileptic data.
